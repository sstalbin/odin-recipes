        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The RecipeTin Eats’ pizza dough recipe has landed! An easy pizza crust that makes an exceptional homemade pizza – puffy crust with a chewy, flavourful crumb inside. Enough structure to pick up, but not thin and stiff like a cracker.</p>
        <p>This is the RecipeTin Eats’ family pizza dough recipe. It’s a rare thing when the entire RTE family agrees on something to do with food. So when I tell you that we all agree this is the best pizza crust recipe, that means something!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>210g bread flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup lukewarm (115 F) water</li>
            <li>1 tsp + 1/8 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast and 1/2 the sugar in the warm water and let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk together flour, salt, and remaining sugar.</li>
            <li>When the yeast is very foamy (at 10 minutes), pour over the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix with a spoon (or with the whisk) until dough comes together into a ball.</li>
            <li>Knead dough for 5-8 minutes on a floured surface. You may need to add a lot more flour if it's really sticky.</li>
            <li>Let proof at 81F for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Roll out, top with toppings, bake for 10 minutes at 480F.</li>
        </ol>
