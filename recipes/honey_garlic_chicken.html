        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Honey Garlic Chicken is an epic 12 minute chicken breast recipe with a magic 5 ingredient Honey Garlic Sauce! This is a terrific back pocket quick dinner idea for busy nights that’s made with pantry staples. It’s quite amazing how so few ingredients can transform into such a tasty sauce for chicken!</p>
        <p>If I were ever to do a summary of my top 5 Most Used Sauces, Honey Garlic Sauce would probably be right at the top of the list. I love it because it requires so few ingredients that are pantry staples, and when simmered with a seared protein in a skillet so it becomes all bubbly and syrupy…. oh WOW.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g / 1 lb chicken breast , boneless and skinless (2 pieces)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
            <li>3.5 TBSP unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1.5 TBSP apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 TBSP soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the breasts in half horizontally to create 4 steaks in total. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Coat chicken in flour and shake off excess.</li>
            <li>Melt most of the butter in a large skillet over high heat - hold back about 1 tsp for later.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in skillet and cook for 2 - 3 minutes until golden. Turn and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Turn heat down slightly to medium high.</li>
            <li>Make a bit of room in the pan and add garlic and top with remaining dab of butter. Stir garlic briefly once butter melts.</li>
            <li>Add vinegar, soy sauce and honey. Stir / shake pan to combine. Bring sauce to simmer, then simmer for 1 minute or until slightly thickened.</li>
            <li>Turn chicken to coat in sauce. If the sauce gets too thick, add a touch of water and stir.</li>
            <li>Remove from stove immediately. Place chicken on plates and drizzle over remaining sauce.</li>
        </ol>
